# Bash study guides

- This is a reference to this file on the local computer: file:///git/pdorwin/scripting/bash/README.md
- This is a [reference]() to this file in a browser (edit this file to see how it is done)

This is a very rudimentary first step in developing a set of study guides.

- [Lesson 01 Hello World](file:///git/pdorwin/scripting/bash/HelloWorld) is the standard first atempt in any language. Come talk to me when you cn run this.
